Fit Map allows users to create their own objects; view, rate and comment other users' objects. 

### Implementation

OpenStreetMap plaform is used to display the geo-layer.

Front-end is written in JavaScript using jQuery and LeafletJS libraries. Thus, Fitmap can be integrated into any web-page of any fitness web-site.

Server API is implemented in Python Flask.
